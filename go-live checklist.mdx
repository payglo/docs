> The connector configurations set up in sandbox, needs to be replicated on Payglo production account.

## Signing of Payglo services agreement

- Ensure that Payglo services agreement is signed and share with Payglo team. In case you need any help, please drop an email to [biz@hyperswitch.io](mailto:biz@hyperswitch.io)

> The Payglo team will share your production Payglo credentials once the above process is completed

## Connector Configurations

- Configure all the required connectors using production credentials on Payglo production dashboard and enable the required payment methods
- Ensure that the payment methods are enabled on connector (payment processor) dashboard
- Enable raw card processing for each connector. Some connectors offer this as a dashboard toggle feature. Some processors might need you to share a PCI Attestation of Compliance over email to enable this. Drop an email to [biz@hyperswitch.io](mailto:biz@hyperswitch.io) if you need any support with PCI AOC

## Secure your API keys

- Make sure your secret key (api-key) is not exposed on the front-end (website/mobile app)
- Ensure that your workflow avoids the duplication or storage of your API keys in multiple locations

## Set up Webhooks

- Configure your webhook endpoint on our dashboard to receive notifications for different events
- Update Payglo’s webhook endpoints on your connector’s Dashboard. Refer [here](https://www.hyperswitch.io/docs/webhooks) for detailed instructions
- Update the connector secret key in our dashboard for us to authenticate webhooks sent by your connector

## Secure your Payments

- Make sure you decrypt and verify the signed payload sent along with the payment status in your return URL
- Always verify the payment amount and payment status before fulfilling your customer’s shopping cart/ service request

## Error Handling

- Make sure your API integration is set up to handle all the possible error scenarios (refer [this link](https://www.hyperswitch.io/docs/error-handling))
- Ensure your Unified Checkout (SDK) integration is set up to handle all the possible error scenarios (refer [this link](https://www.hyperswitch.io/docs/sdkIntegrations/unifiedCheckoutWeb/error-handling))
- Ensure that your integration can handle the entire payments lifecycle and test various scenarios using actual payment details

## Customize and sanity check the payment experience
