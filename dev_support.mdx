# FAQ

## 1. What is Payglo?

Payglo is an open, fast, and reliable payment router. With its single unified API, you can connect to any payment processor and offer diverse payment methods to your customers.

## 2. How does Payglo help me?

Payglo helps you to:

- Improve conversion rates
- Reduce costs
- Simplify payment ops
- Take full control of your payments

It allows you to support multiple payment processors (and all the associated payment methods) with a single API or SDK integration. Hence it saves a lot of Dev efforts to integrate, maintain, and manage payment ops. We believe high-growth businesses should focus on your core product and customer service rather than managing payment ops.

## 3. Is it free?

Yes, the open-source version of the product is 100% free, and you can download and use it under the open-source [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/LICENSE). We also have a hosted version which is FREE to use for up to 10k transactions per month for 6 months. Beyond 10k transactions, each successful transaction will be charged at a nominal $0.04 per transaction. The hosted version comes with a full-stack solution, integration, and ongoing support.

## 4. What is the tech stack used?

The back-end is built on Rust with open-source rust-libraries like Diesel & Serde. The DB and data layers are built in PostgreSQL, Redis, Grafana, Loki, etc. Front-end is built on React Native, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, etc.

## 5. Do you have enterprise support?

Yes, we have 24x7 enterprise support for paid plans. The Enterprise plan comes with a dedicated account manager and anytime call support.

## 6. Who is building and backing this product?

Juspay is funding the initiative, and the product is built by a strong community of developers. The parent company, Juspay, was founded in 2012 with a mission to make payments reliable and frictionless. As of today, Juspay's tech platform processes 35 million payment transactions per day, and its payments SDK is used in more than 1.5 billion apps. It has contributed to multiple payment innovations viz. BHIM App, UPI 2FA SDK, BECKN Foundation, OCEN Protocol, etc. Juspay has 1000+ employees across 6 offices.

## 7. Which countries does it support?

Currently, we support North America (US and Canada). Support for three more countries in Europe is expected in Q2 2023. By the end of 2023, we intend to support 30+ countries across the globe.

## 8. Are you a Stripe alternative?

Nope. You can think of HyperSwitch as "Stripe++" - i.e., it allows you to onboard Stripe and any of its alternatives with a single integration.

Stripe is a payment processor while HyperSwitch is a payment orchestrator and a unified API/SDK to connect to multiple payment processors like Stripe.

We are wire-compatible with Stripe, making it extremely easy to upgrade from Stripe to Stripe++.

## 9. What is a payment orchestrator?

A payment orchestrator allows you to connect to multiple payment processors or gateways or acquirers using a single interface. Some orchestrators allow routing different transactions to different processors based on rules that are defined around factors like payment amount, geography, payment method, issuer, etc.

## 10. How is HyperSwitch different from other payment orchestrators?

HyperSwitch is the only enterprise-grade payment orchestrator which is 100% open sourced. It is fast, reliable, and lightweight. Due to its modern high-performance architecture and the community contribution, it is offered at the best price compared to other alternatives.

HyperSwitch is also the only orchestrator which comes with a custom native SDK, Checkout Page Studio, and an advanced Smart Router.

## 11. What is the HyperSwitch Payments SDK?

Payglo offers multiple SDKs to give your users a seamless and native payment experience. Payment SDK improves developer productivity by offering helper functions for all frequent use cases of payments which can be seamlessly integrated into your app or website.

## 12. What kind of support is available?

HyperSwitch has three plans:

1. Open-core with community support
2. Pro plan comes with hosted solution, compliance-in-a-box, white-labeled card-vault, and 24x7 email support
3. Enterprise plan includes all features of the Pro plan with a dedicated account manager, call support, and custom features.

## 13. What payment processors are currently supported?

Our mission is to support all the major payment processors across the globe. To start with, we support all top payment processors for the North American market. We are soon adding the European and Asian processors.

## 14. Can you add/support a new payment processor?
