## Getting Started with Payglo

> Payglo is an Open Source Payment orchestrator intended to simplify payments for the merchants. With Payglo, you can connect to multiple [Payment processors, aggregators](/docs/dashboard/connectors/), [banks](/docs/paymentMethods/banks), [wallets](/docs/paymentMethods/wallets), [BNPLs](/docs/paymentMethods/payLater), and future payment methods with a few clicks on our dashboard.

### Use API keys to authenticate API requests

> Payglo authenticates your API requests using your account’s API keys. Payglo raises an invalid request error if you don’t include a key, and an authentication error if the key is incorrect or outdated.

You can use the Payglo Dashboard to reveal, revoke, and create secret API keys. If you’re setting up Payglo through a third-party platform (3PP), reveal your API keys in live mode to begin processing payments.

### 1. Get your Payglo API key

- If you have not created a sandbox account, please create one
  <a href="https://app.hyperswitch.io/register" target="_blank">
    <button
      style={{
        borderColor: "#808080",
        marginTop: "1.5rem",
        width: "50%",
        borderRadius: "0.5rem",
        backgroundColor: "#006DF9",
        fontWeight: "600",
        color: "#ffffff",
        boxShadow:
          "0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)",
        ":hover": {
          borderColor: "#808080",
          backgroundColor: "transparent",
          color: "#808080",
        },
      }}
      id="cta-btn"
    >
      Sign Up for Payglo
    </button>
  </a>
- If you have already created a sandbox account, your api key could be fetched from [settings section](https://app.hyperswitch.io/developers).

### 2. Configure your payment processor

- Configure the payment processor of your choice using [Connectors](https://app.hyperswitch.io/connectors) tab on our dashboard. You will need to have the API credentials of the payment processor readily available.
- If you do not have access to the API credentials of your payment processor, do not worry. Payglo has a demo payment processor automatically configured to your sandbox account. It will assist you to simulate various payment flows and assist you in completing the integration.

### 3. Integrate Payglo

- Don’t want to write code? Check out the [Payglo Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/hyperswitch/workspace/hyperswitch/request/25176183-9b4ad6a8-fbdd-4919-8505-c75c83bdf9d6) for a no-code way to get started with Payglo’s API.
- You will be using both a server and a client-side component of Payglo to complete the integration.
- The payment flow begins once your user has added products to a shopping cart and now wishes to make a payment.
  - **Step 1:** Your server will create a payment with Payglo server, to get a client_secret.
  - **Step 2:** Your website loads and initiates the [Payglo SDK](/docs/sdkIntegrations/unifiedCheckoutWeb/) to render a payment widget to the customer. Depending on the customer’s currency and country, the list of payment methods are displayed to the customer.
  - **Step 3:** The customer chooses a payment method, enters additional information (say card details) and hits the pay button.
  - **Step 4:** Payglo SDK securely transmits the payment information to Payglo Server. The Payglo server processes the payment with the most suitable payment processor, as per your smart routing algorithm.
  - **Step 5:** Upon successful payment, the customer is automatically redirected to your payment status confirmation page.
