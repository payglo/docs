With Payglo, you can start offering Paypal to your customers, while enjoying the convenience and developer experience offered by Stripe. You can easily migrate from Stripe to Payglo in five simple steps and add Paypal with a few button clicks. If you are not already integrated with Stripe, all that it takes is 15 minutes to integrate Payglo from scratch. We have ready code snippets to copy-paste and integrate.

## Why is Paypal important for your online business?

If your online business is primarily based out of US, or, if you wish to expand your online business to a global audience, Paypal is a must-have for your business, due to two reasons:

- 70% e-commerce stores in the US already support Paypal
- Get access to 400 million active users across the world

On one hand, Apple Pay is the most popular digital wallet on the planet, but its growth has been largely driven by offline/in-store usage and it is limited to the iOS ecosystem for online payments. On the other hand, GooglePay is a globally popular wallet, but its user growth is largely driven by India (which caters to roughly 70% of its entire user base).

If you wish to start offering Paypal to your customers, Payglo offers you an end-to-end and future-proof payments toolkit.

Here are the key features:

## Unified Analytics and Operations

Payglo offers you a Unified dashboard to track your payments across both the processors. So, you do not have to switch between Stripe and Paypal dashboard to view transactions and initiate refunds.

And you get a single-window view of how your payments are performing across both processors in terms of conversion rates, dispute rate, time to process transaction, and 20+ payments-related metrics.

## Reduced integration effort

Payglo offers a single interface that provides access to all the various integrations of Paypal so that your business is future-proof for payments.

All that you have to integrate is the Payglo SDK, and you won't have the pain of integrating multiple other SDKs. Below are the supported Paypal payment flows by Payglo:

- Paypal Standard Integration
- Paypal Advanced Integration
- Paypal Enterprise Integration (supported via Braintree processing)
- Braintree - Checkout
- Braintree - Vault
- Braintree - Checkout with Vault

While the Standard Checkout of Paypal might be suitable to get started, you might need Native Android/iOS Paypal Checkout flows and Paypal One-touch flows. And the complexity of integration increases as you scale up. Payglo solves them all for you on day one.

## Reduce payment processing costs by 20%

Payglo provides out-of-the-box private card vault and PCI compliant Checkout experience. So you can immediately start using your Paypal account for Credit/Debit card processing.

Once your business starts processing beyond USD 40,000 per month, you can start enjoying the benefits of custom pricing and interchange pricing which can reduce your payment processing costs by 20% to 40%.

## Own your customers’ card on file

As your business scales up, you have the flexibility to negotiate for custom pricing with either of the payment processors.

Payglo is PCI L1 compliant. So, Your customers’ cards are neither stuck with Stripe nor with Paypal. So you always have the additional flexibility to choose from a list of 40+ payment processors to get a better deal and further reduce your payment processing costs.

And in the future, if you wish to become a PCI compliant organization, you can easily migrate all your customers’ cards from Payglo!
